MY LAST paper assigned several reasons why the safety of the #people
would be best secured by union against the danger it may be exposed to
by JUST causes of war given to other nations; and those reasons show
that such causes would not only be more rarely given, but would also be
more easily accommodated, by a national #government than either by the
State #governments or the proposed little confederacies.
