We have heard much of the fleets of Britain, and the time may come, if
we are wise, when the fleets of America may engage attention. But if one
national #government, had not so regulated the navigation of Britain
as to make it a nursery for seamen--if one national #government had not
called forth all the national means and materials for forming fleets,
their prowess and their thunder would never have been celebrated. Let
England have its navigation and fleet--let Scotland have its navigation
and fleet--let Wales have its navigation and fleet--let Ireland have
its navigation and fleet--let those four of the constituent parts of the
British empire be under four independent #governments, and it is
easy to perceive how soon they would each dwindle into comparative
insignificance.
