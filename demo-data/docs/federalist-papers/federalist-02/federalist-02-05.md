With equal pleasure I have as often taken notice that Providence has
been pleased to give this one connected country to one united #people--a
#people descended from the same ancestors, speaking the same language,
professing the same religion, attached to the same principles of
#government, very similar in their manners and customs, and who, by their
joint counsels, arms, and efforts, fighting side by side throughout
a long and bloody war, have nobly established general liberty and
independence.
